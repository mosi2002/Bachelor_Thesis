# Bachelor_Thesis
This is the code for my Bsc thesis about Neural network based state estimation using Lie derivative.




### Introduction
This thesis focuses on problem of state estimation for **Non-linear Dynamics**. The problem with model-based observer is due to the need of solving PDEs. In this thesis i used 

Equation:



### Usage 

To use this code, you will need to install the following Python packages:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

1) run **Main.ipynb** for state estimation.
